# Welcome-to-Trivia-Mind!

    This application creates a challenging, yet fun and immersive form for the user to play Trivia, that will grade you based on how well you do.
The user must answer each question in the given amount of time, or the question will be counted wrong.
When finished with all the questions, a score will be potrayed on-screen.

## How-to-Play

    When first opening the page, the user will be given six categories of questions to choose from, "Music, Geography, Food&Drink, Film&TV, Sports, and Science"
After selecting which category, each question displayed will be on a timer, and must be answered in time for the question to be correct. There will be four answer choices for each question.
Finally, remember to have fun and keep an open MIND!
